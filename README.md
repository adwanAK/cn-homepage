### Tips for adding a photo
For adding a picture to your homepage, you can either:
- link to a URL that shows a picture of you that is already online
- upload a picture and link to it (e.g. on [Imgur](https://imgur.com/))
- upload an image to your forked GitHub repository and link to the *relative URL*
(this means simply writing the image name only, e.g.: `src="my_photo.jpg"`)
